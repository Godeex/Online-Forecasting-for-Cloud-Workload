# Cloud Workload Online Forecasting Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an online forecasting system for cloud workloads. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict future workload patterns based on given data, enabling cloud service providers to optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (for visualization)


### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-workload-forecasting.git
cd cloud-workload-forecasting
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Configure the data collection module to fetch workload data from your cloud services.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data to ensure it meets the requirements of the forecasting models.
3. **Model Training**: Train the forecasting models using historical data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models and select the best one.

## Dashboard

The project includes a web-based dashboard that allows users to visualize the forecasted workload patterns and monitor the performance of the forecasting models. The dashboard is built using Flask and provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the system.
